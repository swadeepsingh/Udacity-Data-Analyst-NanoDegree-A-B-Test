# Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


# A/B Test

Notice that because of the time stamp associated with each event, you could technically run a hypothesis test continuously as each observation was observed.

However, then the hard question is do you stop as soon as one page is considered significantly better than another or does it need to happen consistently for a certain amount of time? How long do you run to render a decision that neither page is better than another?

These questions are the difficult parts associated with A/B tests in general.
